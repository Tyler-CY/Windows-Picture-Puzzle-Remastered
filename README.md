## Description

Windows Picture Puzzle Remastered is a minigame which you can play via Chrome's browser extension.

The inspiration of this project is that I came across such puzzle in a gift shop in real life and realized that Windows once has
a minigame gadget, Picture Puzzle, available in Windows Vista and 7. However, due to security issues, Picture Puzzle and other gadgets such as the Weather
gadget, has been removed ever since. The goal of this project is to recreate the game in modern graphics while keeping all the original features intact, including
its mechanisms and animations.

Challenges faced in this project includes obtaining a copy of the game (which is called off, and instead, videos of its gameplay are watched for references), understanding the hidden mechanisms of the software (e.g. 0 second game winning "feature"), and recreating an updated version of the UI.

This project is built with Javascript, HTML and CSS only.
